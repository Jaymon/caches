# Caches

THIS IS THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF CACHES, THIS IS HERE FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES ONLY, THE INTERFACE FOR CACHES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY, BUT THIS WORKED AND SO I WANTED TO SAVE THIS VERSION SOMEWHERE EASY TO ACCESS THAN THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE COMMIT HISTORY

I don't have time to write the documentation right now, but it works if you set `CACHES_DSN` environment variables:

    caches.interface.redis.RedisInterface://localhost/0

## Thanks

This caching interface is inspired by a module that Ryan Johnson wrote for Undrip.

## Install

Use pip from pypi:

    pip install caches

or from source using pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/firstopinion/caches#egg=caches
